Description: 
    CIMICE is a tool in the field of tumor phylogenetics and
    its goal is to build a Markov Chain (called Cancer Progression Markov Chain, CPMC) in order to model tumor subtypes evolution.
    The input of CIMICE is a Mutational Matrix, so a boolean matrix representing altered genes in a
    collection of samples. These samples are assumed to be obtained with single-cell DNA analysis techniques and
    the tool is specifically written to use the peculiarities of this data for the CMPC construction.
    See `https://github.com/redsnic/tumorEvolutionWithMarkovChains/tree/master/GenotypeEvolutionPaths` for the
    original Java version of this tool.
