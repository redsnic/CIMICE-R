\description{
R implementation of the CIMICE tool.
CIMICE is a tool in the field of tumor phylogenetics and
its goal is to build a Markov Chain (called Cancer Progression Markov Chain, CPMC) in order to model tumor subtypes evolution.
The input of CIMICE is a Mutational Matrix, so a boolean matrix representing altered genes in a
collection of samples. These samples are assumed to be obtained with single-cell DNA analysis techniques and
the tool is specifically written to use the peculiarities of this data for the CMPC construction.
See `https://github.com/redsnic/tumorEvolutionWithMarkovChains/tree/master/GenotypeEvolutionPaths` for the
original Java version of this tool.
