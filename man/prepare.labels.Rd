\alias{prepare.labels}
\title{Prepare node labels based on genotypes}
\usage{
prepare.labels(samples, genes)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{input dataset (mutational matrix) as matrix}

\item{genes}{list of gene names (in the columns' order)}
}
\value{
the computed edge list
}
\description{
Prepare node labels so that each node is labelled with a
comma separated list of the alterated genes
representing its associated genotype.
}
\details{
Note that after this procedure the user is
expected also to run fix.clonal.genotype
to also add the clonal genortype to the
mutational matrix if it is not present.
}
\examples{
require(dplyr)
# compact
compactedDataset <- compact.dataset.easy(example.dataset())
# remove frequencies column from the compacted dataset
samples <- as.matrix(compactedDataset \%>\% select(-freq))
# save genes' names
genes = colnames(samples)
# keep the information on frequencies for further analysis
freqs = as.matrix(compactedDataset \%>\% ungroup() \%>\% select(freq))
freqs = freqs/sum(freqs)
freqs = c(freqs,0)
# prepare node labels listing the mutated genes for each node
prepare.labels(samples, genes)
